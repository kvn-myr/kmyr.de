# Automotive Forensics - A Hands-on Showcase

## Abstract

Modern vehicles are increasingly part of automotive forensics investigations. In addition, modern vehicles are getting more complex and connected at the same time. So there should be enough data that we can use in investigations right? Well, its not that easy!

In this tutorial, I will present automotive, digital forensics, and automotive digital forensic fundamentals. We will require those to solve and actual case. Yes, we will conduct a forensic investigation together! In this case, we will go through all options while analysing evidence items that got handed to us as automotive forensic investigators.

What you will learn:

- General knowledge of automotive fundamentals
- General knowledge of digital forensics
- Knowledge in automotive digital forensics
- Experience in different steps in an automotive digital forensics investigation
- Different options how to approach evidence items
- Challenges in automotive digital forensics
