Hi! My name is Kevin Mayer. I am a PostDoc researcher for automotive digital forensics and security operations centers at the Technical University Ingolstadt and an associate researcher with the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) in Germany. 

My main research areas are implementation of new methods for extraction and analysis of digital evidence in modern and future automotive systems.

I am working at the CARISSMA Institute of Electric, Connected and Secure Mobility (C-ECOS) for a research project called SELFY. My research focus is on automotive digital forensics and vehicle security operation centers.
