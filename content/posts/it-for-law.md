# Guest lecture on Networks, Databases, and Cloud Computing

On February 14th, 2024 I was invited by the University of Groningen to give a guest lecture. The topic addressed the basics of computer networks, the internet, databases, cloud computing. The lecture was given for the law students of the university that require basic computer knowledge for their practices as lawyers.
