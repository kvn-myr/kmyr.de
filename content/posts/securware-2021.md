# Identification of Automotive Digital Forensics Stakeholders

## Abstract

New technologies and features emerging in modern vehicles are widening the attack surface for malicious tampering. As a result, security incidents including vehicles are on the rise. Automotive digital forensics investigations allow resolving such security incidents. This paper presents a stakeholder-based reference model for automotive digital forensics. It is essential to focus on stakeholders to provide the best possible automotive digital forensics investigation for them. We identified twelve distinct stakeholders relevant to automotive digital forensics and assigned them to the vehicle life-cycle's relevant phases. Furthermore, the stakeholders' questions for forensics investigations and their resources get analyzed. We created a Venn diagram to highlight differences and similarities between the stakeholders.
