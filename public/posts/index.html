<p>The publication is a result of the EU-funded <a href="https://selfy-project.eu/">SELFY project</a>. The work is a summary of the implementation of the Vehicle Security Operations Center (VSOC) we developed in the context of <a href="https://www.ccam.eu/">CCAM</a>.</p>
<h2 id="abstract-of-the-publication">Abstract of the publication</h2>
<p>Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are well established in the general IT domain. They provide IT security services, including collecting and correlating data, detecting and analyzing cybersecurity incidents, and applying dedicated reactions to such incidents. With the increasing digital capabilities of modern vehicles, appropriate reactions to cybersecurity incidents for vehicles and their ecosystem should be applied, too. Therefore, we propose a novel architecture for a Vehicle Security Operations Center (VSOC) in a Cooperative, Connected, and Automated Mobility (CCAM) environment. %The architecture consists of four components: an E-box to collect events, a D-box to hold relevant data, an A-box to analyze collected information, and an R-box to apply appropriate reactions to incidents and identified anomalies. To allow participants to consume relevant information, the Vehicle Security Operations Center provides an API to send data to the Vehicle Security Operations Center and participate as a subscriber (i.e., receive data from the Vehicle Security Operations Center).</p> </p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Lithium-ion batteries are becoming essential vehicle components with the ongoing shift to electric vehicles. Battery management systems manage these batteries. Typically, battery management systems used to be placed deep within the vehicle architecture, away from external interfaces. However, with increasing connectivity to backend systems, e.g., to improve monitoring battery properties and optimize charging, battery management systems have moved closer to the attack surface, increasing security risks. Also, batteries will soon be reused in so-called second life applications, e.g., as an energy storage system in a private home. While conventional methods involve removing the battery and reusing it with a new battery management system, modern methods retain the original system. Though security controls exist for first and second life applications, there is a lack of research on the transition phase. This paper analyzes the phase of transferring the battery management system from the first to the second life of particular relevance for security, privacy, and intellectual property. We try to close this research gap by analyzing the security aspects of a battery management system life cycle and its altering system environment. We are defining the transition phase, identifying necessary activities, and providing cybersecurity needs for the transitioning of battery management systems from first to second life.</p> </p>

<p>In June 2023, I participated in a Dagstuhl Seminar (number 23242) focusing on privacy aspects in automated and self-driving vehicles. Here, I gained new insights, connected with very interesting people, and determined various followup research questions for my research areas.</p>
<p>The report for the Dagstuhl Seminar was finally published. I am very happy with the report and new insight we gained during the seminar!</p>
<p>Abstract of the report:
This report documents the program and the outcomes of Dagstuhl Seminar 23242 &ldquo;Privacy Protection of Automated and Self-Driving Vehicles&rdquo;. While privacy for connected vehicles has been considered for many years, automated and autonomous vehicles (AV) technology is still in its infancy and the privacy and data protection aspects for AVs are not well addressed. Their capabilities pose new challenges to privacy protection, given the large sensor arrays that collect data in public spaces and the integration of AI technology. During the seminar, several keynote presentations highlighted the research challenges from different perspectives, i.e. legal, ethical, and technological. It was also discussed extensively why vehicles need to make dynamic assessments of trust as an enabling factor for the secure communication and data sharing with other vehicles, but without increasing any privacy risks. Then, the main objective of the seminar was to produce a research road-map to address the major road-blockers in making progress on the way to deployment of privacy protection in automated and autonomous vehicles. First, the group identified six common scenarios of Cooperative, Connected and Automated Mobility (CCAM) during development and product life-cycle, and analyzed the privacy implications for each scenario. Second, it formulated the need to have a methodology to determine the cost-benefit trade-offs between privacy and other criteria like financial, usability, or safety. Third, it identified existing tools, frameworks, and PETs, and potential modifications that are needed to support the automotive industry and automotive scenarios. Finally, the group explored the interplay between privacy and trust, by elaborating on different trust properties based on performance, on ethical aspects, and on user acceptance.</p> </p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>New technologies and features emerging in modern vehicles are widening the attack surface for malicious tampering. As a result, security incidents including vehicles are on the rise. Automotive digital forensics investigations allow resolving such security incidents. This paper presents a stakeholder-based reference model for automotive digital forensics. It is essential to focus on stakeholders to provide the best possible automotive digital forensics investigation for them. We identified twelve distinct stakeholders relevant to automotive digital forensics and assigned them to the vehicle life-cycle&rsquo;s relevant phases. Furthermore, the stakeholders&rsquo; questions for forensics investigations and their resources get analyzed. We created a Venn diagram to highlight differences and similarities between the stakeholders.</p> </p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The collection and analysis of potential evidence in digital forensic investigations is a challenging task that made its arrival in the automotive domain. It is accompanied by increasingly complex in-vehicle components with high diversity in used technologies and a wide range of external interconnections — which raises the question of what sources of information in which formats are even available for any analysis. The main contribution of this paper is an answer to this question as well as a cross-domain methodology to validate the completeness of the results in a structured way. We introduce a three-step process. It starts with a brainstorming session to create an initial basis of knowledge in a specific area of research. In a second step, system archaeology analyses are employed to establish an advanced knowledge base stemming from design documents and similar resources. The second step widens and deepens the knowledge and provides means to evaluate the quality of the brainstorming session results. The third step establishes expert analyses. Relevant automotive digital forensics stakeholders (e.g., OEMs, suppliers, etc.) were interviewed to collect information from expert groups and evaluate both initial phases. Based on this analytical, syntactic, inductive, and systematic research method, we offer a complete perspective for a specific area of research. The presented methodology is implemented to identify a complete set of data formats in automotive digital forensics. We conducted an online survey to evaluate data formats and tools in digital forensics with 56 experts participating and identified a total of 60 different data formats used in this domain.</p> </p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>In the past years, software became an essential topic in modern vehicles, e.g., with the rise of more and more complex driver assistance systems. The advent of automated driving will drive this trend even further. Today, accident investigation, as well as warranty claim analysis, need to take into consideration an analysis of the rapidly increasing proportion of software and security based implementations as part of modern vehicles, the so-called digital forensics. This paper evaluates the general feasibility of digital forensics on a state-of-the-art vehicle. To do so, we analyzed current digital forensics techniques on a state-of-the-art vehicle to constitute gaps in the automotive forensics process used on in-vehicle sys- tems. We present a general process for automotive forensics to close existing gaps and implemented it on a state-of-the-art vehicle in an in-vehicle device manipulation scenario. The implementation uses the on-board diagnostics interface, the diagnostics over internet protocol, as well as the unified diagnostic services for communication. Our implementation requires automotive Ethernet at the diagnostic interface. Our research shows future directions for efficient automotive forensic as well as the exemplary feasibility of automotive forensic analysis on state-of-the-art vehicles without the need for additional in- vehicle components such as intrusion detection systems or event data recorders.</p> </p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>ansomware gangs have gotten better and more aggressive over the past years. Their used malware is well developed and some offer ransomware-as-a-service. Specific threat actors publish the collected data, if victims do not pay the demanded ransom. This evolvement made this area an interesting research domain for me. My goal is to collect the newest samples of specific ransomware gangs and understand the different actors. I aim to share IOCs, TTPs and other insights with the community. My research should allow people, companies and other institutions to protect themselves from ransomware attacks. At the beginning of this project, I started to analyse samples from different reports by hand. To do this, I used Cutter. This task was very time consuming. In addition, I was not able to gain new insights after analysing a few samples for a specific group. The collected IOCs and TTPs were already know. So I was not able to generate benefit for anyone. So I started to raise the following question: How am I able to collect new samples for specific groups? I identified two options: First, by waiting for new incidents and the corresponding reports. Second, by hunting for ransomware gangs. Obviously, the first option is not very expedient. So I decided to hunt using Yara. I used VirusTotal and Hybrid Analysis to perform my hunts. In my talk, I will quickly explain the goal of Yara and its capabilities. In addition, I will quickly go over the syntax and present best practices I learned after failing miserably at the beginning (more in my example section of the talk). Next, I will explain how I created Yara rules using different tools around r2 (especially Cutter). I will illustrate this for two rules: The maze and clop ransomware. For each rule, I will go in detail how I created and tested them. In addition, I will explain, how I miserably failed at the beginning and what I learned during the journey.</p> </p>
