        <p class="line-summary"> Automotive Forensics - A Hands-on Showcase Abstract Modern vehicles are increasingly part of automotive forensics investigations. In addition, modern vehicles are getting more complex and connected at the same time. So there should be enough data that we can use in investigations right? Well, its not that easy!
In this tutorial, I will present automotive, digital forensics, and automotive digital forensic fundamentals. We will require those to solve and actual case. </p>

        <p class="line-summary"> Identification of Automotive Digital Forensics Stakeholders Abstract New technologies and features emerging in modern vehicles are widening the attack surface for malicious tampering. As a result, security incidents including vehicles are on the rise. Automotive digital forensics investigations allow resolving such security incidents. This paper presents a stakeholder-based reference model for automotive digital forensics. It is essential to focus on stakeholders to provide the best possible automotive digital forensics investigation for them. </p>

        <p class="line-summary"> Structured methodology and survey to evaluate data completeness in automotive digital forensics Abstract The collection and analysis of potential evidence in digital forensic investigations is a challenging task that made its arrival in the automotive domain. It is accompanied by increasingly complex in-vehicle components with high diversity in used technologies and a wide range of external interconnections — which raises the question of what sources of information in which formats are even available for any analysis. </p>

        </p>

        
        <p class="line-summary"> A Generalized Approach to Automotive Forensics Abstract In the past years, software became an essential topic in modern vehicles, e.g., with the rise of more and more complex driver assistance systems. The advent of automated driving will drive this trend even further. Today, accident investigation, as well as warranty claim analysis, need to take into consideration an analysis of the rapidly increasing proportion of software and security based implementations as part of modern vehicles, the so-called digital forensics. </p>

        <p class="line-summary"> Where is my Ransom? Hunting for Ransomware Gangs using radare2 and Yara Abstract ansomware gangs have gotten better and more aggressive over the past years. Their used malware is well developed and some offer ransomware-as-a-service. Specific threat actors publish the collected data, if victims do not pay the demanded ransom. This evolvement made this area an interesting research domain for me. My goal is to collect the newest samples of specific ransomware gangs and understand the different actors. </p>
